        <h4>2. Commercial Use</h4>
        <h5>A. RULES AND RESTRICTIONS</h5>
        <p>If the primary purpose of your application is to derive revenue, it is considered a commercial application. TMDb reserves the right to make these evaluations at the time that you apply for the license. TMDb may also monitor your site or application over time to ensure continued compliance with the appropriate type of API key.</p>
        
        <p>If you're in doubt about whether your application is commercial, here are a few common examples of commercial use that may provide you some guidance:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Users are charged a fee for your product or a 3rd party's product or service or a 3rd party's service that includes some sort of integration using the TMDb APIs.</li>
            <li>You sell services using TMDb's APIs to bring users' TMDb content into your service.</li>
            <li>Your site is a "destination" site that uses TMDb content to drive traffic and generate revenue.</li>
            <li>Your site generates revenue by charging users for access to content related to TMDb content such as movies, television shows and music.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h5>B. APPLICATION FOR A COMMERCIAL API KEY</h5>
        <p>If you want to apply for a commercial API key, go to the following form to see what information you need to provide. Lack of specificity or supporting information could delay your application indefinitely, please be very clear in defining your usage. It is always better to include more detail about your application. Please note that in some cases we may grant your request for a commercial API key subject to your payment of fees, such as to help cover infrastructure costs.</p>
        
        <h4>3. Attribution</h4>
        <p>You shall use the TMDb logo to identify your use of the TMDb APIs.</p>

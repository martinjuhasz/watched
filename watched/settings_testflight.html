    <h2 class="header-apps">Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
    TestFlight App Inc. (the “Company”, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from Developers and Beta Testers on <a href="http://www.testflightapp.com">www.testflightapp.com</a> (the “Website”) and from Users, Developers and Beta Testers through TestFlight or TestFlight Live (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy applies to information that is provided to us through the Website or that we receive through the Services. Our Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, and we will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Website at <a href="http://www.testflightapp.com/privacy">www.testflightapp.com/privacy</a>. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites, applications or services that display or link to different privacy statements. 
    </p>
    <p>
    YOU ARE HEREBY ADVISED THAT YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICES CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, ANY APPLICABLE CURRENT AND PRIOR VERSIONS, AND ANY AMENDMENTS THERETO.

            <h3>
                Understanding the Services and types of users. 
            </h3>
            <p>
            The website provides two different types of services available to three types of user. 
            </p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    <p>
                    The first service is TestFlight which is available to App Developers (“Developers”) and beta testers (“Beta Testers”). Both the Developer and the Beta Tester must sign up at the Website to utilize this service. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    The second service is TestFlight Live which is available to Developers and App users (“Users”). TestFlight Live allows Developers to receive real time analytics from Users so that Developers may improve App performance. A User does not sign up on the Website. 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            Both services operate differently and are addressed separately where applicable in the sections below. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>
                Information Collection: 
            </h3>
            <p>
            Personally Identifiable Information that we collect from TestFlight’s Developers and Beta Testers through the Website. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In the course of using the Website, Developers and Beta Testers may provide us with certain personally identifiable information. This refers to information about Developers and Beta Testers that can be used to contact or identify them, and information on their use of and activities at the Website that may be connected with them (“Website Personal Information”). Website Personal Information that we collect may include, but is not limited to, a Developer or Beta Tester’s name, telephone number, credit card details or other billing information, email address, home and business postal addresses, and Apple iOS Unique Device Identifier (UDID). Website Personal Information may also include information Developers or Beta Testers supply to us concerning their preferences and interests expressed in the course of use of the Website. 
            </p>
            <p>
            When Developers or Beta Testers visit the Website to use the Service, our servers automatically record information that their browser or device provides to us. This information may include, but is not limited to, the Developer or Beta Tester’s computer or device’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page it was visiting before it came to the Website and information it searches for on the Website. Like many websites, we may also use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to the Developer or Beta Tester’s computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use “persistent cookies” to save the Developer or Beta Tester’s registration ID and login password for future logins to the Website; and we use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Website, to better understand how Developers and Beta Testers interact with the Website and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Website. The Developer or Beta Tester can instruct its browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt before accepting a cookie from the websites it visits. If the browser does not accept cookies, however, it may not be able to access all portions of the Website or all functionality of our services. 
            </p>
            <p>
            When a Developer or Beta Tester uploads mobile applications (“App(s)”) to the Website, we may also record certain information related thereto, such as the number of times a Developer or Beta Tester installs an App, the number of Apps a Developer or Beta Tester has access to, the number of times a Developer or Beta Tester views an App’s description, and whether a Developer or Beta Tester tries to install an App without being authorized to. It is important to note that we cannot install a Developer’s App on our devices as each App is encrypted and protected and may only be opened by authorized devices. We also cannot access the release notes or other files packaged with a Developer’s App unless access is expressly granted by the Developer to us. Apps, IPAs, provisioning profiles and other application sensitive information remain the Developer’s property and shall not be part of the Website Personal Information. We make no claim to ownership of any Apps unless created and uploaded by us. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Information we collect from TestFlight Live’s Users through the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
            Users of TestFlight Live do not sign up for the service, so to prevent an intrusion of privacy we have made an effort to minimize the amount of sensitive or identifiable data provided to us by the service. 
            </p>
            <p>
            When a Developer includes the TestFlight Live SDK in an App, we receive certain “User Information” that will help the Developer improve the App experience. User Information is comprised of: timestamp, App version, User’s device name, device model, language, carrier, architecture, network state (i.e. wifi or cellular data), events, errors and the User’s last action in the App. The User Information also includes a device identifier, such as the handset’s UDID; however, this is immediately hidden and converted into a random, proprietary, non-traceable TestFlight ID viewable only to Company and not to the Developer.

            <p>
            How we use User Information in TestFlight Live 
            </p>
            <p>
            User Information will be stored on our secure services and provided to Developers to help troubleshoot crashes, discover bugs and improve Apps. We will analyze the User Information and provide it to Developers in the form of performance metrics, error reporting and user utilization information. We may also aggregate the User Information for other reporting. We will not sell or expose the User Information to third parties. Although we take best efforts to protect User Information, we are not responsible for use by any Developers of any data about their Users. Users should review the Developer’s policies to understand their use of Users’ data.

            <p>

            </p>
            <ol type="a">

                    <p>
                    <u>Developers and Beta Testers.</u> We will display Website Personal Information in each Developer and Beta Tester’s profile page and elsewhere on the Website according to the preferences set in each account. Any information a Developer or Beta Tester chooses to provide should reflect how much it wants other users to know about it. We recommend that each Developer or Beta Tester guard its anonymity and sensitive information, and we encourage Developers and Beta Testers to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. Developers and Beta Testers can review and revise their profile information at any time.

                    <p>
                    <u>Service Providers, Business Partners and Others.</u> We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Website-related services (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Website’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how the Website and Services are used. These third parties have access to your Website and User Personal Information solely for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf. We intend to make reasonable efforts to ensure that these third parties execute industry standard confidentiality agreements to protect Website and User Personal Information.
